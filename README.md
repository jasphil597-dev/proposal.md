# Simple Note-Taking App with Authentication

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple and user-friendly Note-Taking App that allows users to securely store, manage, and organize their notes. The app will include features such as user authentication (sign-in and sign-up), basic note creation and editing, and the ability to manage notes through a clean, intuitive interface.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication
- **Sign Up**: Users can create an account using their email and password.
- **Sign In**: Users can securely log in using their email and password.

### 2. Notes Management
- **Create Notes**: Users can create new notes with titles and content.
- **Edit Notes**: Users can modify or update the content of existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Users can delete their notes when no longer needed.
- **Organize Notes**: Notes will be listed on the dashboard, with a clean UI for easy access.

### 3. User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: The app will be designed to work seamlessly across both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Note Dashboard**: A simple dashboard that lists all the user's notes, with options to create, edit, and delete notes.
- **Search Functionality**: A search bar to easily find notes by title or content.

### 4. Data Persistence
- **Backend Storage**: Notes will be stored securely in a database (e.g., MongoDB).
- **Authentication Storage**: User credentials and session information will be stored securely (e.g., hashed passwords in the database).

### 5. Security
- **Password Encryption**: User passwords will be securely hashed using bcrypt or another hashing library to prevent password leaks.

### Frontend:
- **Javascript
- **Css
- **Html

### Backend:
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js (for RESTful API)
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing notes and user data)
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt.js for securely hashing passwords

## User Stories
### 1. User Sign Up
- As a new user, I want to create an account with my email and password so that I can store my notes securely.

### 2. User Sign In
- As a registered user, I want to log into my account so that I can access my stored notes.

### 3. Note Creation
- As a user, I want to create notes with titles and content, so that I can keep track of my thoughts.

### 4. Note Editing
- As a user, I want to edit my existing notes, so that I can update or correct the content.

### 5. Note Deletion
- As a user, I want to delete notes, so that I can remove unnecessary information from my account.

### 6. Notes Dashboard
- As a user, I want to view all of my notes in a dashboard with options to edit or delete them.

### 7. Search Notes
- As a user, I want to search for specific notes by title or content, so that I can easily find what I'm looking for.
